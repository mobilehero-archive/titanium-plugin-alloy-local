## 📝 Description

Here are how things currently work by default:

- [Titanium Mobile](https://www.npmjs.com/package/titanium) will use the globally installed [Alloy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/alloy) package when compiling mobile apps.
- [Appcelerator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/appcelerator) bundles a version of [Alloy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/alloy) with it and will use that when compiling mobile apps.

The goal and purpose of this plugin is to allow you to install a specific version of [Alloy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/alloy) locally and to be able to have Titanium and/or Appcelerator use this when compiling your app.

## 🚀 Getting Started

> NOTE:  Before installing this plugin, make sure you have a `package.json` file in the root of your project.   If you don't, you can just run the following in the project root directory and it will create one for you:

```
npm init --yes
```

To install this plugin, run the following in the project root directory:

```
npm install --save-dev @titanium/plugin-alloy-local
```

This will install the npm package as well as run a post-install script that will also create the Titanium plugin for you.

> Don't worry about having this plugin installed if you do not have Alloy installed locally.  If the plugin cannot find Alloy locally, it will fallback to the default location depending on your tool (see above).
